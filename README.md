# This is an Instagram bot an attempt at automating an Instagram account 
by having a bot manage to follow, comment, and like users on Instagram 

The bot is intended to find specific criteria of people on the internet but current development only looks to find universities and 
College students in USA schools by checking their bio for the schools they are in (this feature has not been added yet)

the bot will use a depth-first algorithm to get the accounts following the students since a student is bound to have other students as followers.
the bot will be nerfed to try and pass undetected to prevent the account from being banned

the bot is still very early in development but shouldn't take long to complete
